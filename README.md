## Requirement
### Android
- Java 17 is required for the sample app.
### iOS
- Xcode 14.1+    
Install Apple’s Xcode development software: [Xcode in the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

- CocoaPods    
**CocoaPods** is a dependency manager for iOS projects. [Install CocoaPods by Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cocoapods). (suggestion)    
  > Check if Homebrew is installed:

  ```shell
  $ brew
  ```

  > How to install Homebrew on MacOS: [Link](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3.html)

## Authenticate the npm registry

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your [GitHub setting](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Use the `Configure SSO` button next to your created token to authorize `circlefin` organization. More instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens), and check below links for creating GitHub PAT:
- [Creating a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
- [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
    

## Installation
```shell
yarn add @circle-fin/w3s-pw-react-native-sdk
```
### Android
Add the maven repository to your `android/build.gradle`. It's suggested that load settings from the `local.properties`:
```properties
repositories {
	...
	maven {
        	Properties properties = new Properties()
		// Load local.properties.
        	properties.load(new File(rootDir.absolutePath + "/local.properties").newDataInputStream())

		url properties.getProperty('pwsdk.maven.url')
		credentials {
        		username properties.getProperty('pwsdk.maven.username')
        		password properties.getProperty('pwsdk.maven.password')
		}
	}
}
```
Add the maven setting values in the `local.properties` file.
```properties
pwsdk.maven.url=https://maven.pkg.github.com/circlefin/w3s-android-sdk
pwsdk.maven.username=<GITHUB_USERNAME>
pwsdk.maven.password=<GITHUB_PAT>
```
> **Note**
> When pasting the values above for `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<GITHUB_PAT>`, make sure to not surround the values with quotes.
### iOS
Run the command under `ios/`:
```
pod install
```
## New Architecture Support
The SDK is supporting both React Native old and [new architectures](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page).
You can enable or disable the new architecture by changing the project setting.
### Android
Set the `android/gradle.properties` file as below to enable new architecture or false to disable. 
```properties
newArchEnabled=true
```
### iOS
Reinstall your pods by running pod install with the right flag:
```shell
bundle install && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 bundle exec pod install
```
Or run without flag to use old architecture:
```sh
pod install
```
## Run the Sample App
1. Edit `src/config.json` ➜ `pw_app_id` to fill in your `APP ID`.
